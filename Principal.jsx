          The core purpose of education is to provide children with a learning environment which brings out the best in them. We believe that every child is endowed with a unique set of attributes and abilities, which need to be nurtured so that they blossom. Therefore, every child deserves an education that fosters academic excellence and all-round development, and ensures their well-being. We are inspired by these tenets in everything that we do at Bhondawe Patil Public School.
At our school, we provide a learning environment that inspires and motivates children, and encourages them to explore limitless possibilities in their quest for knowledge. Right from inception, our overarching goal will be to make BPPS a HAPPY SCHOOL, where teaching is a pleasure and learning is a joy; where learning and excelling is a passion, and culture and values have a pre-eminent place.
Our caring and committed teachers are our pillars of strength. They teach our children not just with their minds but with their hearts. They make learning enjoyable and rewarding, and imbibe in children the importance of sound values. Our excellent educational programmes are complemented by state-of-the art facilities and resources, and our focus on sports and co-curricular opportunities facilitates children"s holistic education.
We aspire to lead our school with a global perspective but with an Indian mind, an Indian heart and an Indian soul. All these inspire us to continue to do our best, in preparing children for the 21st century.
I welcome you to an abode of learning and excelling.
Best Wishes with Regards & Gratitude</span>
